                      <th>I am currently working as an office manager at Dr Joseph Zimmer’s dental office, while studying software development at Codefellows. One of my greatest strengths is my ability learn quickly and to be able to be a strong team player. I am very interested in securing a role at a tech company that allows me to utilize my computer programing skills, and also learn skills I do not already have. Because software development and being a team player were such a key part of my schooling, it’s important for me to find the perfect fit for myself and the company where I can utilize those skills to the fullest. Thank you for your time.</th>
